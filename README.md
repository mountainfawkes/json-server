This project was built to manipulate JSON data for the purpose of reducing problematic file sizes. It uses Node.js to write a new file with data manipulations executed with JavaScript. It is simple and effectively reduced the filesizes of input by 50%+.

First attempts at this operation included a fake REST API built without coding in 30 seconds (well maybe more like 10 minutes) for the purpose of manipulating and saving JSON data to be utilized elsewhere. For more information and full documentation on this useful but ultimately tangential implementation, check out [typicode](https://github.com/typicode/json-server/blob/master/README.md) on GitHub. Huge thank you to *typicode* for making this possible!
